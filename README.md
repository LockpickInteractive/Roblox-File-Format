# Roblox-File-Format (Legacy)
This is a branch holding the version of Roblox-File-Format required to build [Rbx2Source version 2.63 or Below](https://github.com/StarLandRBLX/Rbx2Source/releases/tag/2.63).             
It is no longer required and should not be used in recent versions as it is insecure and has multiple security vulnerabilities.
